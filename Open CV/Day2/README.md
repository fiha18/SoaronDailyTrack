Imutils are a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV and both Python 2.7 and Python 3.
Installing imutils 
	pip install imutils 

Images are read as a numpy multi-dimensional array, image height, width and depth are equivalent to shape of rows, number of columns and number of channels respectively.
Depth is the number of channels â€” I am working with 3 color channels: Blue, Green, and Red.
In OpenCV color images in the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space have a 3-tuple associated with each pixel: (B, G, R).
